# weatherapp
Creating my first web app using the darksky API, Google places API and skycon API

This is a simple web app which utilizes REST API. 

Functionality:
A user enters any address
The address is then transformed into a lat,lng
The client post the lat lng to the server. The server then makes a request to the darksky API and all weather data for that lat,lng is returned. 
The server then sends the weather information back to the client and the client displays: the current temperature, the wind speed and the precipitation percentage.
